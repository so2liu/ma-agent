## Why This App?

The [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) is a powerful toolkit for building AI agents that can execute code, manage files, search the web, and perform complex multi-step tasks. However, using it typically requires programming knowledge, terminal commands, and installing developer tools like Node.js, Python, and package managers.

**Claude Agent Desktop removes most of these barriers.** Designed for all knowledge workers, not just engineers, it packages the full power of the Claude Agent SDK into a simple desktop application:

- **Practical local tooling** — The app bundles [bun](https://bun.sh) for JavaScript/TypeScript workflows plus portable Git/Unix tools on Windows. Python workflows can use tools already available on your machine.
- **Accessible workspace** — Your agent workspace defaults to `~/Desktop/claude-agent`, a shared environment for mutual collaboration. The agent can build applications, generate spreadsheets, and create documents here, while you can drag and drop your own files into the folder for the agent to analyze and work with.
- **Pre-configured [Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)** — Built-in capabilities for document handling, data analysis, and more are automatically available without any configuration.
- **Full agent capabilities** — Execute scripts, analyze files, create documents, automate workflows, and tackle complex knowledge work—all through natural conversation.

Whether you're a researcher analyzing data, a writer managing documents, or anyone who wants AI to actively work on your computer rather than just chat, this app lets you harness frontier agent capabilities without opening the terminal or writing a single line of code.
